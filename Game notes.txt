Ant types:
	Queen - Reproduction only. Lays all eggs.
	Workers - Forage, feed larva, nest construction
	Scout - Search for food
	Soldier - Patrol, fight enemies

Pheromone logic:
	The nest emits a "colony scent" that dissapates in a radius around it.
	When an ant is searching for food, it leaves a "searching" pheromone, and it follows a "found" pheromone if nearby.
	When an ant has found food, it leaves a "found" pheromone, and it follows a "searching" pheromone if nearby.
	When an ant (not soldier) encounters an enemy, it leaves an "alarm" pheromone, and flees toward any familiar pheromone in this order: "Colony scent", "found", "searching", or in a zig-zag random motion.
	When a soldier ant encounters an enemy, it leaves an "alarm" pheromone, and starts attacking.
	Soldier ants will always follow the strongest "alarm" pheromone nearby, and patrol the hive if no alarm pheromones is present.
